The Jabber is a fast light fighter with four lasers. Although it has very light armour, it is very fast and quite manoeuvrable. The blueprint is provided for [free](#download-blueprint). All [feedback](#providing-feedback) is welcome and in game tips (in-game name Egomaniac) are appreciated. However support will be limited but I will try my best.

TIP: You can craft your own crates, generators (T2), box and triangle thruster components (T2) and ship weapons to reduce assembly cost.

## Download Blueprint

The blueprint file is available in the `blueprints` folder [here](https://github.com/vinteo/starbase-ships/raw/main/jabber/blueprints/jabber.fbe).

## Known Issues

- The ship has practically no armour
- I have pretty much zero combat experience and this is my first fighter
- This ship has not been tested in combat at all

## Usage

To enter the ship, there is a button in front the cockpit that will open the glass `Canopy`. There is also a button for `Hatch` below the ship. Buttons for these are available in the pilot console.

### Flying the Ship

![Pilot Console](images/pilot_center_console.jpg)

The left lever on the center console controls backwards thrust (braking) and the right lever controls forward thrust.

| Interface | Function |
|---|---|
| `ForwardThrust` | Current forward thrust, maximum of 10,000 units |
| `Cruise` | Activates cruise control, forward thrust will not reset to zero unless turned down. |
| `Aim` | Reduces the response time of key presses for pitch and yaw. |
| `Turtle` | Activates turtle mode which sets forward thrust to a maximum limit of `TurtleRate` of full thrust. |
| `Sloth` | (Right Console) Activates the low sensitvity mode of pitch and yaw by limiting thrust. Use the `Sensitivity` switch to set the maximum thrust rate of sloth mode.|
| Transponder `Toggle` & `Ping` | Transponder controls, `Toggle` turns on and off ship transponder while `Ping` will activate transponder for three seconds |
| `ISAN2`, `Heading`, `Dest`, `DTW`, `Deltas`, `WP`, `Up`, `Down`, `Save` & `Home` | See [ISAN Waypoint System](https://github.com/Archaegeo/Starbase/tree/45a9bb464cb71d7de7a214f8e665111d6b2b5989/ISAN-Waypoint%20System) for more informaton. |
| `Timer` | See [Timer](#timer). |
| `Odometer` | See [Odometer](#odometer). |
| `Battery` | Shows current battery charge of the 20 batteries, maximum of 10,000 units. |
| `StoredHeat` | Shows current stored heat in heat sinks, maximum of 15,000 units. |
| `Shutdown` | Turns off fuel chambers. |
| `Generator` | Current generator rate, maximum of 100%. |
| `RadiationRate` | Current radiation rate, maximum of 100%. |
| `Min Generator Limit` & `Min Gen` | Toggle and sets minimum generator rate. See [Managing Power](#managing-power). |
| `Fuel Rod Left` & `Fuel Rod Right` | Fuel remaining on fuel rods in individual fuel chambers, maximum of 300,000 units for each. |
| `Propellant` | Total propellant remaining in propellant tanks, maximum of 8,000,000 units. |
| `PropTime` | Time and distance remaining of propellant based on current usage. Distance is calculated from ISAN speed*. |
| `FuelTime` | Time and distance remaining of fuel based on current usage. Distance is calculated from ISAN speed*. |
| `Flow In` & `Flow Out` | Toggle flow modes of resource bridges. See [Refueling Propellant](#refuelling-propellant). |
| `Canopy` | Open and closes the cockpit glass canopy. |
| `Hatch` | Open and closes the hatch below the ship. |
| `Service` | Open and closes the service hatches on either side the ship for access to the fuel rods and ammo magazines. |

### Combat

| Interface | Function |
|---|---|
| `Fire` | Fire lasers, best bound to a key and held down to fire. |
| `Combat` | Activates combat mode which enables lasers and starts charging them. |
| `Crosshair` | Activates beam crosshair. |
| `Laser Ammo Right 1`, `Laser Ammo Right 2`, `Laser Ammo Left 1` & `Laser Ammo Left 2` | Ammo remaining on lasers, maximum of 600 units for each. |
| `Laser Ammo Heat 1`, `Laser Heat Right 2`, `Laser Heat Left 1` & `Laser Heat Left 2` | Heat generated on lasers, maximum of 1,000 units for each. |
| `Laser Ammo Power 1`, `Laser Power Right 2`, `Laser Power Left 1` & `Laser Power Left 2` | Power remaining on lasers, maximum of 5,000 units for each. |
| `Red` lights | Each row of four lights for each laser representing heat. Each light represents 200 units of power. Blinks when heat reaches 600 units. |
| `Blue` lights | Each row of four lights for each laser representing ammo. Each light represents 150 ammo. Blinks when ammo drops below reaches 150. |
| `Green` lights | Each row of four lights for each laser representing power. Each light represents 1,250 units of power. Blinks when power drops below 1,250. |

When entering combat, activate `Combat` to turn on lasers and start charging the lasers. `Crosshair` activates the beam crosshair for target aimming. Use `Fire` to fire the lasers. It is best used bound to a key and then holding down the key to fire. Lasers fire alternating in pairs of one each of each side.

For longer sustained firing, activate `Min Gen` with a `Min Generator Rate` of 100.

Open the `Service` hatches for access to the ammo magazines.

#### Managing Power

By default the generator will only run and ramp up when the batteries need charging so there is minimum management needed. But you can set a minimum generate rate by setting the `Min Generator Limit` value using the switch for the minimum rate and turning on `Min Gen`.

Open the `Service` hatches for access to the fuel rods.

#### Refueling Propellant

The resource bridgescan be used for refuelling propellant. To refuel from another ship, turn off `Flow Out` on the pilot console and leave `Flow In` turned on. Then connect a resource bridge to the other ship. To refuel another ship, do the opposite, `Flow Out` turned on and `Flow In` turned off.

### Other Stuff

#### Timer

On the pilot center console there is a `Timer` panel which acts as a timer. It will run when the ship is active and show total time in years, weeks, days, hours, minutes and seconds. To reset the timer, use your universal tool (`U` key) and clear the value of the `Timer` field.

#### Odometer

On the pilot right console there is a `Odometer` panel which will keep track of the ship's estimated flight distance based on speed from ISAN (may not be that accurate). To reset the trip odometer, use your universal tool (`U` key) and clear the value of the `Odometer` field.
